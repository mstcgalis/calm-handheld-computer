# Create Your Own Calm Handheld Computer

The aim of the workshop is to jointly create a calm handheld computer for each participant
as an alternative to mainstream social networks.

Number of participants: 2–8
Duration: 6 hours

## Structure
1. Meditation – The workshop begins with a short meditation focused on peripheral
awareness. Participants are invited to freely explore the available materials and tools
(clay, sensors, fabrics, etc.).

2. Discussion – Facilitated critical dialogue on the negative effects of social networks,
anchored in critical deconstruction: consumption vs. connection, group feed...
Participants are invited to reflect on their own use of social networks and the
subsequent negative social effects, especially in relation to feelings of belonging.

3. Initiation – Participants are introduced to the Calm Handheld Computer through the
electronic components. Everyone can choose their input interface.

4. Construction – The facilitator helps participants construct and launch their own
computer. Pre-soldered devices are also available. Next, participants create a body
from any material they choose.

5. Ritualization – The group may decide to assign meaning or ritualistic regularity to
nonverbal interactions. What purpose can the devices serve in the context of a
particular community?

6. Reflection – Together, we reflect on the workshop from our relative positions. The
emphasis is on working with different materials, whether clay or soldering wire, and
on feelings of belonging.

## Materials

Clay, paper, cardboard, fabric, ESP-32 mini development boards, KY-040 rotary sensors,
buttons, capacitive touch sensors, vibration motors, batteries, soldering materials, glue, dirt,
sand, plastic containers...

## Workshop outcome

Each participant will create their own prototype based on the Calm Handheld Computer
design, adapted to their personal needs and aesthetic preferences. The resulting devices
often reflect the participants' unique relationships to community, touch, and attention.
It is possible that some participants will incorporate the use of these computers into their
existing rituals—for example, as part of their daily meditation or as a subtle way to remind
someone of their presence without the need for words.
